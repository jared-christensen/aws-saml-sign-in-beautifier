If your company manages many AWS accounts, selecting the right role from the AWS SAML login page (`https://signin.aws.amazon.com/saml`) can be frustrating. This project removes friction from the process by:

- Turning role radio buttons into submit buttons – No need to scroll down and click "Sign In"
- Organizing the Account list into two columns – Quickly find the right Account
- Adding color coding for clarity – Visually differentiate accounts

Designed for users managing multiple AWS accounts.
